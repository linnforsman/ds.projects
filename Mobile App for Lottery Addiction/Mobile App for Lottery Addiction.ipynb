    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we are going to contribute to the development of a mobile app by writing a couple of functions that is meant to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning and, hopefully, to prevent them from this dangerous habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lotto_6/49), where six numbers are drawn from a set of 49 (from 1 to 49) for each ticket, and a player wins the big prize if the six numbers on their tickets match all the six numbers drawn. Our goal is to create the logical core of the app and build functions that enable users to answer these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "The historical data used in this project comes from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) counts 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018.\n"
